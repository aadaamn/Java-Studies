Everything related to java (during universities studies)

Dear future me, Im writing this on 13 September 2022, nothing much but I hope you somehow will achieve your dreams which is to study abroad whether in MIT or University of Manchester and also to be a data analyst/software engineer. Let's be honest here, no one will expect you to do anything, but its up to you whether you want to achieve your dreams or not. In 2 years and so on , let's hope we can improve ourself in terms of coding style, communications and relationship whether between friends of families;

It's been so hard since you got that shitty spm result, so we both know how much we want to change ourself to be a better person, right? Have faith in Allah and never give up Adam! Remember, it's not about getting 6 in dice with the first roll, it's about rollin' it till you get the 6!

So, have fun & never give up to achieve your dream. Your parent dah tua, so this would be the last chance to make them happy and bangga dengan yourself.
